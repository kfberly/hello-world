Hello everyone!

I am 45, married with two wonderfully huge and goofy Great Danes and I'm excited to learn
new skills and just info about programming. I'm hoping to one day translate this knowledge
into a career path for me as I am currently no longer excited about the job/agency I have been in 
for the last 12 years.
